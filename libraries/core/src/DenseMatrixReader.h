			 * The file format is based on chunks, that, with the exception of the
			 * header can be stored in an arbitrary order.
			 * 
			 * The basic chunk format is as follows:
			 * 
			 * CHUNK-ID  : uint8_t   --- The identifier of the chunk
			 * CHUNK-SIZE: uint64_t  --- The size of the CHUNK-DATA field in bytes
			 *                           forwarding the file cursor CHUNK-SIZE bytes
			 *                           will either reach the next CHUNK or EOF
			 * CHUNK-DATA: This field depends on the current chunk
			 * 
			 * Chunk Types (ID):
			 *  * HEADER (0x00):
			 *   - ROW-COUNT:     uint32_t --- The number of rows of the matrix
			 *   - COL-COUNT:     uint32_t --- The number of columns of the matrix
			 *   - STORAGE-ORDER: uint8_t  --- Zero if the matrix is stored in row major
			 *                                 non-zero if it is stored in column major
			 *  * ROWNAMES (0x01):
			 *   Contains ROW-COUNT zero terminated names.
			 *
			 *  * COLNAMES (0x02):
			 *   Contains COL-COUNT zero terminated names.
			 * 
			 *  * DATA (0x03):
			 *   Contains ROW-COUNT * COL-COUNT double values of entries
			 *   in the storage order specified in the header.
