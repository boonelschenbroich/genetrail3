GeneTrail2
==========
This is the GeneTrail2 C++ library, a collection of algorithms and statistics
for processing gene expression data. It provides the compute kernels for the
[GeneTrail2 web service](https://genetrail2.bioinf.uni-sb.de).

Installation
------------
Currently we only support building GeneTrail2 under Linux. Windows and MacOS X
are not supported. For compiling GeneTrail2 you need the following software:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) >= 4.9 or [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) >= 3.5
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 2.8.12.2
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) >= 1.55
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) >= 3.2.3
- [RapidJSON](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) >= 1.0.2
- [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) >= 5.0.0 (optional)
- [Google Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest/) >= 1.7.0 (optional)

Create a directory named `build` in the source directory. Inside the build
directory type:

	cmake -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen3/ -DGTEST_SRC_DIR=/path/to/gtest/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

If all goes well you can now compile a version of GeneTrail2
by typing:

	make

For installing GeneTrail2 specify the installation path using `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PATH=`
and type:

	make install

If you built with support for the Google Test Framework, you can run the unit
tests by typing

	make test

A suite of more expensive integration tests can be started by typing

	make integration_test
